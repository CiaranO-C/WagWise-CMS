#### Create a new article
Users can access the new article feature from either the sidebar or from the card directly at the top of the home screen. Met by the TinyMCE Rich text editor users can easily write and style new content, including a section which facilitates both the creation and application of tags onto each article.

Upon saving your new article, React router will take you to the Edit article page, as your content is now stored in the database with its own Article ID.  

#### Navigate to new article
New articles are set to unpublished by default, we can locate the newly created article via navigating to the unpublished section within the Articles page, or from simply selecting the 'unpublished' option on the Home page articles card.

### Comment Features
Unfortunately comments aren't always nice! Whether offensive content is left on your site, or spam and scams, the comment flagging system simplifies moderating unwanted messages. Offensive content is automatically flagged and sent to the ‚ÄúReview‚Äù section on the Home page, while less obvious or nuanced content can be reviewed individually on the Comments page, with the ability to flag multiple comments and delete them all at the click of a button.. or individually!

### Auth
Through a protected component layer and continuous server checks, users are automatically redirected to the login page when their access token has expired or becomes invalid, and no refresh token is available. This system ensures only authenticated users can access the site, prompting them to re-login when necessary to regain access.
