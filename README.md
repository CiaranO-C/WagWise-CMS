### Article Features
#### Create a new article
Users can access the new article feature from either the sidebar or from the card directly at the top of the home screen. Met by the TinyMCE Rich text editor users can easily write and style new content, including a section which facilitates both the creation and application of tags onto each article.

Upon saving your new article, React router will take you to the Edit article page, as your content is now stored in the database with its own Article ID.  

#### Navigate to new article
New articles are set to unpublished by default, we can locate the newly created article via navigating to the unpublished section within the Articles page, or from simply selecting the 'unpublished' option on the Home page articles card.
